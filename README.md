# Welcome!

### My name is Becca Jones, and I am a Marine Bology and Ecology Master's student at the University of Miami.

### My current research uses Bayesian occupancy modeling to investigate if our estimates of abundance and diversity of sharks in the South Florida area could be biased because of the fishing gear we use.
